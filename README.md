Meta Legend
===========

This site aggregates top-level Hearthstone replays from hsreplay.net from:

* Replays publicly posted on the homepage feed
* Replays submitted by users via webhook

It's meant to be a resource for seeing what types of decks are viable
in the current metagame at the top levels, and to help players learn
from top players by seeing the decisions they make in their replays.
